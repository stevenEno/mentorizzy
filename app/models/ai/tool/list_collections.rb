class Ai::Tool::ListCollections < Ai::Tool
  description <<-MD
    Lists all collections accessible by the current user.
    The response is paginated so you may need to iterate through multiple pages to get the full list.
    Each collection object has the following fields:
    - id [Integer, not null]
    - name [String, not null]
    - url [String, not null]
